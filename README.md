The Alert Service generates and routes alerts for Intel速 RSP Controller
status, Advance Shipping Notices, and upstream service alerts.

- *Intel速 RSP Controller Status*: 
    the service listens to EdgeX Core Data for controller heartbeats and,
    if it misses multiple consecutive heartbeats, it sends an alert.
- *ASN Events*:
    when enabled, the service verifies Advance Shipping Notices' products' 
    statuses and sends alerts for any that aren't whitelisted.
- *Upstream Alerts*:
    the service processes incoming alerts from other services and posts them to 
    a configured REST endpoint.
